most Universa operations, compatible with older Android API levels.

Features available:

* [BOSS](https://github.com/sergeych/boss_protocol) serialization.
* [Safe58](https://kb.universablockchain.com/safe58/67) encoding.
* RSA private and public keys, with all Universa-specific operations (like, RSA-OAEP encoding and RSASSA-PSS signatures).
* [Key addresses](https://kb.universablockchain.com/key_address/68).
* AES cryptography, PBKDF2 key derivation and so on.
